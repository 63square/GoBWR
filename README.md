<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

GoBWR is my attempt to create a realistic, fully working physics simulation of a BWR using Go. I am a complete beginner to Go, and would like to use this project to expand my knowledge on physics (namely reactor physics), learn the Go language and expand my knowledge in other areas of programming.
